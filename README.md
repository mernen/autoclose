AutoClose â€” is a package designed to reduce the entire boilerplate from things that can be `.dispose()`d, `.close()`d or whatever!

## What exactly does this package do?

![It turns this into that](assets/it-turns-this-into-that.png "It turns this into that")

Let's take a closer look at what happened. On the left side you can see the `dispose()` block that has 
completely disappeared on the right side. And this is a definite advantage. But on the other hand, 
you may think differently. The stream subscription required three lines: variable declaration, subscription 
initialization, and subscription cancellation. Now we need a combined initialization and cancellation 
block + add a mixin to the class (and at the same time remember what the corresponding mixin is called). 
The advantages are no longer so obvious. Let me try to clear your doubts.

## Installation

First of all you need to install this package

```
flutter pub add autoclose
flutter pub add autoclose_flutter
```

For now this package is useless for pure dart without flutter. But I hope sometime it will be changed.

If you are using the Bloc state manager you also should install corresponding package

```
flutter pub add autoclose_bloc
```

If you would like to see other state managers then let me know.

And I highly recommend you to install lint package

### AutoClose_Lints installation

Lints were created using custom_lint package (thank to guys from Invertase to that help in my dream setup). 
So that the installation is accompanied by corresponding and somewhat specific installation requirements of custom_lint:

```
flutter pub add dev:autoclose_lints dev:custom_lint
```

Add the following lines to your analysis_options.yaml:

```
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint
```

Additionnaly you can [configure lints for your project](https://github.com/invertase/dart_custom_lint#enablingdisabling-and-configuring-lints).
For first time I recommend to enable all lints (this is default) to review all places which needs to your attention with closable things.
